# Network Creation & Management

## Raw Idea
Users can create private networks with custom names, generate invite codes, and manage basic network settings through the desktop app.

## Context
- **Phase**: Phase 1 - Core Networking (MVP)
- **Effort**: Medium (1 week)
- **Priority**: First feature in roadmap - foundation for all other networking features

## User Confirmation
User confirmed this feature with the following scope:
- ✅ Private network creation (custom name)
- ✅ Invite code generation (gc:// protocol support)
- ✅ Basic network settings management
- ✅ Desktop app UI
- ✅ Backend API endpoints
- ✅ WireGuard interface configuration
- ✅ IP allocation (IPAM service)
- ✅ Database schema and migrations
- ✅ Member management basics (owner role)

This is a foundation feature - all other features (Network Join Flow, Peer Discovery, Chat, etc.) require this to be completed first.
