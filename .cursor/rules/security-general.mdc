# Secure Development Principles for GoConnect

## 1. Do Not Use Raw User Input in Sensitive Operations
- Untrusted input must never be used directly in:
  - File access
  - Command execution
  - Database queries
  - URL construction

## 2. Do Not Expose Secrets in Code
- API keys, credentials, private keys must NOT appear in:
  - Source code
  - Public repositories
  - Client-distributed files
  - Frontend code

## 3. Enforce Secure Communication
- Always use HTTPS/TLS for external communications
- Minimum TLS version: 1.2
- Never disable certificate verification

## 4. Avoid Executing Dynamic Code
- No `eval()` or similar with untrusted input
- No dynamic code construction

## 5. Validate All External Input
- Validate inputs from:
  - Users
  - External APIs
  - Third-party systems
  - Environment variables

## 6. Do Not Log Sensitive Information
- Never log:
  - Credentials/tokens
  - Personal identifiers
  - Private keys
  - Session IDs

## 7. Prevent Disabling Security Controls
- Security checks must not be disabled without:
  - Documented justification
  - Code review approval

## 8. Limit Trust in Client-Side Logic
- Critical logic must be server-side:
  - Authentication
  - Authorization
  - Input validation
  - Business rules

## 9. Eliminate Hardcoded Credentials
- Use environment variables or secret managers
- Never commit secrets to version control
